# **Search and Download images**
We created a search engine called Foxign, which, using Google's APIs, returns us images. In the research you can put some filters. There are three filters: the first one is "imgType"; it return images of one type, that can be clipart, face, lineart, stock, photo and animated; the second filter is "imgColorType; it returns black and white, grayscale, or color images: mono, gray and color; the last filter is "imgDominantColor"; it returns images of a specific domiant color: red, orange, yellow, green, teal, blue, purple, pink, white, gray, black and brown. We also created a bot on telegram, called foxign bot (username = @ImgDownloader_bot) , which allows you to have the photos that you have searched on the site. Keys for APIs and bot's token will be given by the developers
