# **FOXING** 
### **Engine for search and download images**
We created a search engine called Foxign,
which, using Google's APIs, returns us images. 
We add some filters to make more easier your research:
 - **imgType**: Return images of a specific type,  
 _clipart, face, lineart, stock, photo and animated_; 
 - **imgColorType**: Returns black and white.  
  _grayscale, or color images: mono, gray and color_; 
 - **imgDominantColor**: Returns images of a specific dominant color.  
 _red, orange, yellow, green, teal, blue, purple, pink, white, gray, black and brown_;  

###**Telegram Bot**  
  We also created a Telegram Bot, named **Foxign** (`@ImgDownloader_bot`) ,   
  which allows you to have the photos that you have searched on the site
  directly in your Telegram's bot chat.  
  
  
  _Keys for APIs and bot's token will be given by the developers_
